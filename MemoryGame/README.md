# Memory Game

My first ever C# project made as a coding task.

### Why do I code? 

I created my first programs in BASIC when I was around 11 years old and didn't even have a computer (using a book titled "Przygody z komputerem i bez komputera"). It was fascinating that I could make computers do things for me. Fast forward almost 30 years and I began rediscovering that fascination while looking to change careers. At the moment, I code mostly to learn, but hopefully in the future I'll be able to solve some actual problems.
